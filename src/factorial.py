# Must raise ValueError for negative numbers
# To calculate the factorial of a number, multiply that number by every positive integer less than it, down to 1. 
# For example, 4 factorial (written as 4!) is calculated as 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, which equals 24. 
# The general formula is n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1.
